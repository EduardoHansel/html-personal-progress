<h1>The Best Movies According to Myself</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>I had never seen anything like it until then. It's just extremely well made and the soundtrack is top notch.</p>
<h3>Cars (2007)</h3>
<p>This movie is responsible for consolidating my love for the automotive world.</p>
<h3>Rush</h3>
<p>Although it's in 3rd place, it's my favourite movie about my favourite sport, which is F1. </p>
